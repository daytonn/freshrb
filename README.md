# Fresh.rb

A Ruby application framework for the paranoid ruby developer who values configuration over convention.

## Installation

While tools like bundler greatly increase maintainability and developer convenience, it's Fresh.rb's philosophy that every decision should be left open to the developer. While you *may* install Fresh.rb with `gem install freshrb`, we recommend you download the tarball, inspect each line and then install the gem locally from source to ensure you agree with the code executed on your machine.

## Usage

```sh
freshrb myapp
```

This will create a Fresh.rb application in the current directory.

## Features

Fresh.rb does everything you could possibly imagine. All with simple ruby! Simply implement the feature you have in mind and BAM! Fresh.rb just hooked you up.

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( http://github.com/daytonn/freshrb/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
6. Most likely your pull request will be rejected to accomodate the highest degree of compatability with any developer workflow
